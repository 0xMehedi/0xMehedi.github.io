[{"content":" Fedora Workstation comes with vanilla GNOME as its desktop environment, which is, in my opinion, a bit too bare-bones for everyday tasks. A few actions can be taken to improve this experience. This article will examine what to do following the installation of Fedora Workstation 38. Keep in mind that this is by no means an exhaustive list.\nTo-Do Assign Keyboard Shortcut to Launch Terminal Out of the box, there is no keyboard shortcut available to open a terminal. To assign a keyboard shortcut to open the terminal of your choice,\nGo to Settings \u0026gt; Keyboard \u0026gt; Click on View and Customize Shortcuts from the \u0026ldquo;Keyboard Shortcuts\u0026rdquo; Section \u0026gt; Scroll down to Custom Shortcuts \u0026gt; Click Add Shortcut.\nA pop-up window requesting a Name, Command, and Shortcut will appear.\nIn the Name field, enter GNOME Terminal as the name. In the Command field, enter the command gnome-terminal. In the Shortcut field, press the key combination that you want to use to launch GNOME Terminal. For example, Ctrl + Alt + T. Click the Add button. Change Hostname The default hostname is \u0026ldquo;fedora\u0026rdquo;. Change it to your liking to make it easily discoverable in your local network.\nTo change the hostname, open a terminal and issue the following command:\n1 sudo hostnamectl set-hostname \u0026#34;Penguin\u0026#34; In the example above, \u0026ldquo;Penguin\u0026rdquo; is the desired hostname.\nChange Swappiness The swappiness sysctl parameter represents the kernel’s preference for swap space. A lower swappiness value means that the kernel will be less likely to swap memory to disk. This can improve performance, but it can also lead to memory pressure if you do not have enough RAM.\nThe optimal swappiness value will vary depending on your system and your workload. You may need to experiment to find the value that works best for you.\nYou can check the current swappiness value by running the following command:\n1 sysctl vm.swappiness To set the swappiness value permanently, create a sysctl.d configuration file. For example:\n1 2 3 sudo mkdir -p /etc/sysctl.d sudo touch /etc/sysctl.d/local.conf printf \u0026#39;%s\\n\u0026#39; \u0026#39;vm.swappiness=10\u0026#39; | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/local.conf Run the following command to apply the changes:\n1 sudo sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/local.conf Enable Minimize or Maximize Button If you are not comfortable without the Minimize and Maximize window buttons, there is a way to bring them back.\nOpen a terminal and issue the following command to enable the minimize and maximize buttons:\n1 gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences button-layout \u0026#34;appmenu:minimize,maximize,close\u0026#34; The minimize and maximize buttons will now be enabled in all application windows.\nChange Appearance Fedora 38 Workstation offers both Light and Dark modes. Choose one from Settings \u0026gt; Appearance according to your liking.\nYou might as well change the desktop background if you want a more appealing look.\nTweak Privacy Options File History \u0026amp; Trash \u0026ldquo;File History\u0026rdquo; feature makes it easier for you to find files that you might want to use. If you do not like the feature, go to Settings \u0026gt; Privacy \u0026gt; File History \u0026amp; Trash and turn it off from the \u0026ldquo;File History\u0026rdquo; section.\nTrash and temporary files can sometimes include personal or sensitive information. Automatically deleting them can help to protect your privacy. I highly recommend you enable this feature.\nGo to Settings \u0026gt; Privacy \u0026gt; File History \u0026amp; Trash \u0026gt; Enable Automatically Delete Trash Content and Automatically Delete Temporary Files from the \u0026ldquo;Trash \u0026amp; Temporary Files\u0026rdquo; section.\nMouse \u0026amp; Touchpad Since Fedora has a reputation for staying as close to upstream as possible, they follow the various defaults selected by the desktop environment upstreams. Generally, this entails a disabled touchpad click by default.\nTo enable tap to click, Go to Settings \u0026gt; Mouse \u0026amp; Touchpad \u0026gt; Enable Tap to Click from the \u0026ldquo;Touchpad\u0026rdquo; section.\nConfigure DNF DNF configuration file is located at /etc/dnf/dnf.conf. Behavior of DNF can be configured by editing this file.\nThe number of parallel downloads can be modified to get faster downloads if your internet connection is suitably fast.\nFirstly, open the DNF configuration file with nano:\n1 sudo nano /etc/dnf/dnf.conf Then append the following line and save:\n1 max_parallel_downloads=6 Enable 3rd Party Repositories Enable RPM Fusion RPM Fusion is a third-party repository that provides access to a wider range of software than what is available in the Fedora repositories.\nTo enable RPM Fusion, open a terminal and type the following command:\n1 2 sudo dnf install https://mirrors.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm sudo dnf install https://mirrors.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm After that, install the appstream-data package so that Gnome Software or KDE Discover may be used to install GUI programs from RPM Fusion.\nThe following command will install the required packages:\n1 sudo dnf groupupdate core Enable Flathub Flatpak is installed by default on Fedora Workstation. To begin, simply enable Flathub, which is the best way to obtain Flatpak apps.\nRun the following command to enable it:\n1 flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo That is it! You now have access to unfiltered Flathub on Fedora.\nUpdate System You should run a system update as soon as possible after installing Fedora. This will install the latest security patches and bug fixes, and it will also ensure that you have the latest version of all of your software.\nTo do this, open a terminal and run the following command:\n1 sudo dnf upgrade Install Media Codecs Fedora is a great Linux distribution, but it does not come with all the media codecs you might need out of the box. If you try to play a video or audio file that uses a codec that is not installed, you will get an error message.\nTo fix this, you need to install the necessary codecs. There are a few different ways to do this, but the easiest way is to use the RPM Fusion repository.\nUse a terminal to install packages that provide multimedia libraries from the RPM Fusion repository.\nSwitch to full FFmpeg The FFmpeg library that is shipped with Fedora 38 does not support H.264 decoding. Switch to the RPM Fusion\u0026rsquo;s better supported FFmpeg build and follow the next section for additional codecs or plugins.\n1 sudo dnf swap ffmpeg-free ffmpeg --allowerasing Install Additional Codec Install the additional multimedia packages required to enable the gstreamer framework-based application and other multimedia tools to playback other restricted codecs.\nTo do this, open a terminal and run the following commands:\n1 2 sudo dnf groupupdate multimedia --setop=\u0026#34;install_weak_deps=False\u0026#34; --exclude=PackageKit-gstreamer-plugin sudo dnf groupupdate sound-and-video Enable DVD Playback Install the libdvdcss package from the RPM Fusion repository to enable DVD playback.\n1 2 sudo dnf install rpmfusion-free-release-tainted sudo dnf install libdvdcss Enable VA-API VA-API stands for Video Acceleration API. It is an open-source API that allows applications to use hardware video acceleration capabilities, usually provided by the GPU.\nVA-API is supported by a wide range of hardware vendors, including Intel, NVIDIA, and AMD. To enable VA-API on your system, you will need to install the appropriate drivers and libraries.\nPlease be aware that for VA-API to function as intended, the full FFmpeg build is required. Before continuing, make sure ffmpeg from the RPM Fusion repository is installed.\nIntel VA-API support for newer GPUs are provided by intel-media-driver. Visit upstream to see which platforms are supported by this driver.\nRun the following command to install it:\n1 sudo dnf install intel-media-driver VA-API support for older GPUs are provided by libva-intel-driver. Run the following command to install it:\n1 sudo dnf install libva-intel-driver AMD For AMD, run the following commands to enable VA-API:\n1 2 sudo dnf swap mesa-va-drivers mesa-va-drivers-freeworld sudo dnf swap mesa-vdpau-drivers mesa-vdpau-drivers-freeworld If using i686 compatibility libraries (e.g. Steam):\n1 2 sudo dnf swap mesa-va-drivers.i686 mesa-va-drivers-freeworld.i686 sudo dnf swap mesa-vdpau-drivers.i686 mesa-vdpau-drivers-freeworld.i686 Nvidia The Nvidia proprietary driver does not support VA-API, but there is a wrapper that can bridge NVDEC/NVENC with VA-API\nRun the following command to install it:\n1 sudo dnf install nvidia-vaapi-driver Conclusion I hope this gives you a good starting point for getting started with Fedora 38. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the comments below.\n","date":"2023-08-27T00:00:00Z","image":"https://0xMehedi.github.io/p/2023/08/27/12-things-to-do-right-after-installing-fedora-workstation-38/fedora_hu12788665439769305664.jpg","permalink":"https://0xMehedi.github.io/p/2023/08/27/12-things-to-do-right-after-installing-fedora-workstation-38/","title":"12 Things to Do Right After Installing Fedora Workstation 38"},{"content":" Ubuntu is well configured out of the box. But there are a few things you can do to enhance your experience. In this article we will look at what to do after installing the latest version of Ubuntu.\nTo-Do Update the System After installing Ubuntu, you should update it as soon as possible. Linux operates on a local database of available packages, which must be synced before you can install any software.\nTo upgrade your system, open the terminal by pressing Ctrl + Alt + T and execute the following commands:\n1 2 sudo apt update sudo apt upgrade Install Restricted Formats Due to patent and copyright restrictions, Ubuntu does not ship non-free formats by default. Certain media formats would not be supported by Ubuntu if Restricted Formats are not installed. If you use Microsoft Office files, the absence of Microsoft typefaces may probably present you with problems.\nIf you are using regular, stock Ubuntu, you can install them by entering the following in a terminal:\n1 sudo apt install ubuntu-restricted-extras Additionally, in order to play encrypted DVDs, you need to install libdvdcss.\n1 2 sudo apt install libdvd-pkg sudo dpkg-reconfigure libdvd-pkg Install Drivers The open-source drivers included with Ubuntu perform as expected. However, if proprietary drivers provide your system better performance, you might still wish to install them. It is rather easy to do so.\nOpen App Grid \u0026gt; Click on Additional Drivers \u0026gt; Select Recommended Drivers \u0026gt; Apply Changes.\nNote that you need to wait while it searches for the drivers.\nSet up Firewall It is advisable to enable a firewall that protects against network intrusions. I recommend you install Gufw as it is one of the easiest firewalls for Linux.\n1 sudo apt install gufw After the installation, open Gufw from the App Grid, authenticate, and then enable the firewall.\nEnable ZRAM ZRAM is a kernel module that provides a compressed block device in RAM and thus holding much more information in the RAM. ZRAM could improve responsiveness in case a system often falls back to swap.\nThe easiest way to enable ZRAM on Ubuntu is to install the systemd-zram-generator package.\n1 sudo apt install systemd-zram-generator You may need to reboot your system for the ZRAM devices to show up.\nChange Swappiness The swappiness sysctl parameter represents the kernel\u0026rsquo;s preference for swap space. Lower values ​​mean the kernel will try to avoid swapping, while higher values ​​will cause the kernel to aggressively try to use swap space.\nCheck the current swappiness value by running the command sysctl vm.swappiness in a terminal.\nTo set the swappiness value permanently, create a sysctl.d configuration file. For example:\n1 2 sudo touch /etc/sysctl.d/local.conf printf \u0026#39;%s\\n\u0026#39; \u0026#39;vm.swappiness=10\u0026#39; | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/local.conf Reboot and check the swappiness value again. It should be set to 10 now.\nAdd Support for Password Protected Archives The default archive manager uses unzip as a backend to extract zip archives, which does not support password-protection. There is a different backend named p7zip-full that offers extra functionality, including support for password-protected archives. After installation, the Archive Manager will switch to using this backend.\nYou can install it from the terminal by the following command:\n1 sudo apt install p7zip-full Enhance AppImage Support AppImage applications do not run in Ubuntu 22.04 despite having the correct file permissions. The reason for that most AppImages are still using version 2 of the FUSE file system, whereas Ubuntu 22.04 includes version 3. It would not be a problem once AppImages upgrades to the latest version of the FUSE file system.\nIn the meantime, you can install FUSE 2 alongside FUSE 3 to deal with this inconvenience.\n1 sudo apt install libfuse2 Install dconf Editor dconf Editor is a graphical viewer and editor of applications’ internal settings. In other words, the dconf Editor can view and edit settings that are not generally exposed through the GUI.\nYou can install it by using this command:\n1 sudo apt install dconf-editor Enable Minimize on Dock Click It is unpleasant that an open app window in Ubuntu 22.04 cannot be minimized by clicking the app\u0026rsquo;s icon on the Dock. This behavior can be changed easily with the help of dconf Editor.\nOpen App Grid \u0026gt; Click on dconf Editor \u0026gt; Navigate to /org/gnome/shell/extensions/dash-to-doc/click-action \u0026gt; Disable Use default value \u0026gt; Select 'minimize' from the Custom value.\nChange Appearance Ubuntu 22.04 features two styles: Light and Dark.\nChoose the one you like from Settings \u0026gt; Appearance and pick a Color to give your system a personal touch.\nYou may also choose the size of the app icons on the dock and where on the screen the dock appears, as well as enable Panel mode.\nTweak Privacy Options File History \u0026amp; Trash \u0026ldquo;File History\u0026rdquo; feature makes it easier for you to find files that you might want to use. If you do not like the feature, go to Settings \u0026gt; Privacy \u0026gt; File History \u0026amp; Trash and turn it off from the \u0026ldquo;File History\u0026rdquo; section.\nTrash and temporary files can sometimes include personal or sensitive information. Automatically deleting them can help to protect your privacy. I highly recommend you enable this feature.\nGo to Settings \u0026gt; Privacy \u0026gt; File History \u0026amp; Trash \u0026gt; Enable Automatically Delete Trash Content and Automatically Delete Temporary Files from the \u0026ldquo;Trash \u0026amp; Temporary Files\u0026rdquo; section.\nDiagnostics Newer Ubuntu installations come with Problem Reporting enabled by default. This feature automatically reports the technical problems to Canonical Ltd. anonymously, in an attempt to make Ubuntu better for everyone. You can change the behavior of this feature to show a dialog for each error before sending its report to Canonical. You may also choose to disable this feature altogether.\nGo to Settings \u0026gt; Privacy \u0026gt; Diagnostics and then select Manual or Never from the Send error reports to Canonical dropdown menu in the \u0026ldquo;Problem Reporting\u0026rdquo; section.\nTweak Power Settings Out of the box, Ubuntu automatically suspends the system after 20 minutes of inactivity when running on battery power. I like being able to suspend the system whenever I choose. You can also turn off this behavior if you wish.\nGo to Settings \u0026gt; Power \u0026gt; Click on Automatic Suspend in the \u0026ldquo;Power Saving Options\u0026rdquo; section \u0026gt; Disable Automatic Suspend for both On Battery Power and Plugged In.\nDisplays You can now customize the scaling of your screen if you have a Hi-DPI one. Thanks to the feature \u0026ldquo;Fractional Scaling\u0026rdquo; introduced in Ubuntu 20.04. If you see a blank screen, your screen is not capable of supporting the scaling you have chosen, and it will revert to the previous scaling after 15 seconds.\nGo to Settings \u0026gt; Displays \u0026gt; Switch to the Displays tab \u0026gt; Enable Fractional Scaling and then choose among 100%, 125%, 150%, 175%, and 200%.\nUbuntu has a function called Night Light that lessens the amount of blue light that the display emits. When activated, this helps in reducing eye strain.\nGo to Settings \u0026gt; Displays \u0026gt; Switch to the Night Light tab \u0026gt; Enable Night Light.\nMouse \u0026amp; Touchpad By default, the left or right mouse button action requires you to press the left or right touchpad button, which is annoying. Enable the tap to click option and just tap the touchpad anywhere to get the same functionality.\nGo to Settings \u0026gt; Mouse \u0026amp; Touchpad \u0026gt; Enable Tap to Click from the \u0026ldquo;Touchpad\u0026rdquo; section.\nConfigure Keyboard You can make your keyboard behave like a keyboard with a different layout, regardless of the letters and symbols printed on the keys. This is useful if you often switch between multiple languages.\nGo to Settings \u0026gt; Keyboard \u0026gt; Click the + button in the \u0026ldquo;Input Sources\u0026rdquo; section \u0026gt; Select the language which is associated with the layout \u0026gt; Select a layout and press Add.\nSet Region \u0026amp; Language Date and Measurement Formats To conform to regional customs, you can modify the formats used for dates, times, numbers, currencies, and measurement.\nGo to Settings \u0026gt; Region \u0026amp; Language \u0026gt; Click on Formats \u0026gt; Select the desired Region \u0026amp; Language \u0026gt; Click Done.\nRestart the session for the modifications to take effect.\nChoose Default Applications Ubuntu comes with Rhythmbox preinstalled but for some reason sets \u0026ldquo;Video\u0026rdquo; as the default app to open Music files. Change it to \u0026ldquo;Rhythmbox\u0026rdquo; for a better experience listening to music.\nGo to Settings \u0026gt; Default Applications \u0026gt; Choose Rhythmbox from the Drop-down list for Music.\nInstall Extension Manager Ubuntu employs GNOME as its desktop environment, as you may know. Thanks to its extensions, GNOME can be completely customized. While certain extensions are pre-installed, more can be installed with \u0026ldquo;Extension Manager\u0026rdquo; app.\nOpen the terminal and install Extension Manager with the following command:\n1 sudo apt install gnome-shell-extension-manager Install Tweaks Along with the GNOME extensions, GNOME Tweaks is a useful software that aids in personalizing your GNOME desktop. GNOME Tweaks offers options to install additional themes, adjust fonts, change the location of Windows buttons and a few more.\n1 sudo apt install gnome-tweaks Conclusion You could invest a significant effort in customizing and configuring your system. It is personal preference that ultimately matters. Let me know if you find this list helpful.\n","date":"2022-09-18T00:00:00Z","image":"https://0xMehedi.github.io/p/2022/09/18/things-to-do-after-installing-ubuntu-22.04/ubuntu-22.04_hu14226249610980849576.jpg","permalink":"https://0xMehedi.github.io/p/2022/09/18/things-to-do-after-installing-ubuntu-22.04/","title":"Things to Do After Installing Ubuntu 22.04"},{"content":" Websites built with Static Site Generator (SSG) are faster, more secure, and dev-friendly. They are also easier for SEO. It can be difficult to choose a suitable SSG because there are many. However, Hugo and Jekyll is the most popular choice among developers.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s compare Hugo with Jekyll, shall we?\nComparison Ease of Install If you are a MacOS or Linux user, you can install Hugo with a single command. For instructions about how to install Hugo on other operating systems, follow the official installation guide.\nCommand for MacOS: brew install hugo\nCommand for Linux (Ubuntu): sudo apt install hugo\nInstalling Jekyll is not as straight forward as installing Hugo. However, there is an excellent installation guide to get started with Jekyll.\nExternal Dependencies Unlike many other static site generators, Hugo does not require any external dependencies to run. All you need is the Hugo binary.\nJekyll, on the other hand depends on Ruby. So, Ruby needs to be configured first in order to install Jekyll.\nSpeed Hugo is currently the fastest static site generator in the market. It can generate thousands of webpages in just a few seconds. That saves a lot of time when your site starts growing in size.\nJekyll is at least 3 times slower than Hugo. That means Jekyll needs significantly more time than Hugo to build the same site.\nFlexibility Hugo is very flexible in terms of content structure. It can be used to build various types of websites. For example, Blog, Documentation, Portfolio, and many others.\nOn the other hand, Jekyll is best known for its inbuilt features to help you create a fully featured blog. More functionalities can be added via third-party plugins.\nConclusion In terms of features, they are both comparable. Choosing between the two is challenging. This website is built with Hugo, as you may have observed. How do you feel about Hugo and Jekyll? Which would you choose and why?\n","date":"2022-05-26T00:00:00Z","image":"https://0xMehedi.github.io/p/2022/05/26/hugo-or-jekyll/hugo-or-jekyll_hu10732924500354514240.png","permalink":"https://0xMehedi.github.io/p/2022/05/26/hugo-or-jekyll/","title":"Hugo or Jekyll?"}]

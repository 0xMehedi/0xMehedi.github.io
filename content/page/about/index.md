<!-- cspell:words Mehedi Hasan bogura lastmod -->

Hi, I am Mehedi Hasan.

I grew up in a Bangladeshi family, and I live in Bogura, Bangladesh.

In my free time, I tinker with Free and Open Source Software.
Aside from that, I love to go for long walks with friends to enjoy the beauty of nature.

This blog aims to share my experience with anyone interested enough.
So if you have any queries or recommendations, please feel free to email me.

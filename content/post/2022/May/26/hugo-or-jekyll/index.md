Websites built with Static Site Generator (SSG) are faster, more secure, and dev-friendly. They are also easier for SEO. It can be difficult to choose a suitable SSG because there are many. However, Hugo and Jekyll is the most popular choice among developers.

Let's compare Hugo with Jekyll, shall we?

## Comparison

### Ease of Install

- If you are a MacOS or Linux user, you can install Hugo with a single command. For instructions about how to install Hugo on other operating systems, follow the official [installation guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing).

  - Command for MacOS:
    `brew install hugo`

  - Command for Linux (Ubuntu):
    `sudo apt install hugo`

- Installing Jekyll is not as straight forward as installing Hugo. However, there is an excellent [installation guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) to get started with Jekyll.

### External Dependencies

- Unlike many other static site generators, Hugo does not require any external dependencies to run. All you need is the Hugo binary.

- Jekyll on the other hand depends on Ruby. So, Ruby needs to be configured first in order to install Jekyll.

### Speed

- Hugo is currently the fastest static site generator in the market. It can generate thousands of webpages in just a few seconds. That saves a lot of time when your site starts growing in size .

- Jekyll is at least 3 times slower than Hugo. That means Jekyll needs significantly more time than Hugo to build the same site.

### Flexibility

- Hugo is very flexible in terms of content structure. It can be used to build various types of websites. For example, Blog, Documentation, Portfolio, and many others.

- On the other hand, Jekyll is best known for its inbuilt features to help you create a fully featured blog. More functionalities can be added via third-party plugins.

### Conclusion

In terms of features, they are both comparable. Choosing between the two is challenging. This website is built with Hugo, as you may have observed. How do you feel about Hugo and Jekyll? Which would you choose and why?
